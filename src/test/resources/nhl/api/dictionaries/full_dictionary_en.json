Jagr has said he'd love to play hockey until he's 50, and though he lacks the speed he had as a young player, his smarts and high-end offensive instincts show no signs of diminishing.",
  "kane": "Kane has saved his best work for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. His overtime goal in Game 6 of the 2010 Final gave the Blackhawks their first Stanley Cup championship in 49 years. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP during Chicago's run to the Cup in 2013, and shared the scoring lead in 2015 to help Chicago win its third championship in six seasons. He's on a career path that figures to put him in the mix when the conversation turns to the best U.S.-born players of all time.",

He surpassed Mike Richter's franchise record for wins during the 2013-14 season, when he led the Rangers to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in 20 years. Lundqvist holds the franchise records for appearances, wins and shutouts, and he won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender in 2011-12. Along the way, Lundqvist has become a New York sports icon and one of the greatest players in franchise history.",

He's being counted on as the centerpiece of the Oilers' revival.",

  "standingsPlayoffFormatDesc": "16 teams will qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The format is a set bracket that is largely division-based with wild cards. The top three teams in each division will make up the first 12 teams in the playoffs. The remaining four spots will be filled by the next two highest-placed finishers in each conference, based on regular-season record and regardless of division. It is possible for one division in each conference to send five teams to the postseason while the other sends just three. In the First Round, the division winner with the best record in each conference will be matched against the wild-card team with the lesser record; the wild card team with the better record will play the other division winner. The teams finishing second and third in each division will meet in the First Round within the bracket headed by their respective division winners. First-round winners within each bracket play one another in the Second Round to determine the four participants in the Conference Finals. Home-ice advantage through the first two rounds goes to the team that placed higher in the regular-season standings. In the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Final, home-ice advantage goes to the team that had the better regular-season record -- regardless of the teams' final standing in their respective divisions.",

This figure is reflected in the RW column. \nThe greater number of games won, excluding games won by Shootout. This figure is reflected in the ROW column. \nThe greater number of games won by the Club in any manner (i.e, \"Total Wins\"). This figure is reflected in the W column. \nThe greater number of points earned in games against each other among two or more tied clubs. For the purpose of determining standing for two or more Clubs that have not played an even number of games with one or more of the other tied Clubs, the first game played in the city that has the extra game (the \"odd game\") shall not be included. When more than two Clubs are tied, the percentage of available points earned in games among each other (and not including any \"odd games\") shall be used to determine standing. \nThe greater differential between goals for and against (including goals scored in Overtime or awarded for prevailing in Shootouts) for the entire regular season. This figure is reflected in the DIFF column. \nThe greater number of goals scored (including goals scored in Overtime or awarded for prevailing in Shootouts) for the entire regular season.
